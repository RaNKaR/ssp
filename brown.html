        <h1>Happy people</h1>
        <p>A sample of 222 undergraduates was screened for high happiness using 
        multiple confirming assessment filters. We compared the upper 10% 
        of consistently very happy people with average and very unhappy 
        people. The very happy people were highly social, and had stronger 
        romantic and other social relationships than less happy groups. 
        They were more extroverted, more agreeable, and less neurotic, 
        and scored lower on several psychopathology scales 
        of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. 
        Compared with the less happy groups, the happiest respondents 
        did not exercise significantly more, participate in religious 
        activities significantly more, or experience more objectively 
        defined good events. No variable was sufficient for happiness, 
        but good social relations were necessary. Members of the happiest 
        group experienced positive, but not ecstatic, 
        feelings most of the time, and they reported occasional 
        negative moods. This suggests that very happy people do have 
        a functioning emotion system that can react appropriately 
        to life events.

    <h2>15 Habits of Incredibly Happy People</h2>
    <p>While happiness is defined by the individual, 
        I’ve always felt it foolish to declare that nothing can be learned 
        from observing the happiness of others.
        Examining how to be happy is benefited from observing the patterns 
        of others, and then taking only what you find useful. 
        Inspiration is the goal, not rigid rules on being happy.
        I’ve gone over dozens of research papers in the pursuit 
        of learning more about the subject — happiness in work and 
        life is a topic to take seriously, so I’m always on the hunt for
        inspiration and insight.
        Below I'll cover a few of my favorite studies.

    <h3>Think of Yourself Less</h3>
    <p>
        <q>Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of 
        yourself less.</q>
        Thoughtful words from C.S. Lewis, but do they equate to real life 
        happiness? Our self-esteem is a bit of a tricky topic, 
        because current research on self-esteem paints a very inconsistent 
        picture: it seems that high self-esteem is certainly related 
        to happiness, but it can produce other problems with the ego.
        For instance, a variety of research suggests that self-esteem 
        that is bound to external success can be a fickle beast — certain 
        students who tied their self-esteem to their grades experienced 
        small boosts when they received an acceptance letter (grad school), 
        but harsh drops in self-esteem when they were rejected.
        Indeed, similar findings were reported for those who base their 
        self-esteem on career success and appearance. Conversely, those 
        who do not tie their self-esteem as strongly to external motivators 
        tend to have less of a “roller coaster” of emotions to the things 
        that happen to them, and are generally more happy as a result.
