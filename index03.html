        <p>Winter is the coldest season
        of the year in polar and temperate
        climates (winter does not occur in 
        tropical climates). It occurs after
        autumn and before spring in each year.
        Winter is caused by the axis of the
        Earth in that hemisphere being oriented
        away from the Sun. Different cultures 
        define different dates as the start of winter,
        and some use a definition based on weather. When
        it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer 
        in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. In many regions,
        winter is associated with snow and freezing temperatures.
