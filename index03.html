        <p>Winterer is the coldest season
        of the year 2052 in polar and temperate
        climates (winter does not occur in 
        tropical climates). It occurs after
        autumn and before springls in each year.
        Winter is caused by the axises of the
        Earth in that hemisphere being oriented
        away from the Sasdasdasdasdun. Different cultures 
        define different dates as the start of winter,
        and someasdasd use a definition based on weather. When
        it is winter in the Noarthern Hemisphere, it is summer 
        in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. In many regions,
        winter is associated sdasdasdasdasdwith snow and freezing temperatures.
