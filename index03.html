        <p>Winter is the coldest season
        of the year in polar and temperate
        autumn and before spring in each year.

        Winter is caused by the axis of the

        Earth in that hemisphere being oriented
        away from the Sasdasdasdasdun. Different cultures 
        define different dates as the start of winter,
        and someasdasd use a definition based on weather. When
        it is winter in the Noarthern Hemisphere, it is summer 
        in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. In many regions,
        winter is associated with snow and freezing temperatures.
